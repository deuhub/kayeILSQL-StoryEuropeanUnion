    <div class="note-95">
        <p>The European Union is unique.
            It is not a federal State like the United States of America,
            nor is it a purely intergovernmental organisation like the
            United Nations.
            The European Union (EU) is a family of democratic European countries
            working together
            to improve life for their citizens and to build a better world.</p>

    </div>
    <p></p>

    <div class="note-97">
        <p>EU is a remarkable success story. In just over half a century,
            it has delivered peace and prosperity in Europe,
            a single European currency (the euro) and a frontier-free
            'single-market'
            where goods, people, services and capital move around freely.
            It has become a major trading power, and a world leader in fields
            such as environmental protection and development aid. </p>

        <p>The European Unionâ€™s success owes a lot to the unusual way
            in which it works.</p>

    </div>
    <p></p>
    <h2 id="seu_unusual">Unusual way in which the European Union works</h2>

    <div class="note-117">
        <p>European Union works in an unusual way, because its
            'member states' remain independent sovereign nations but
            they pool their sovereignty in order
            to gain a strength and world influence none of them
            could have on their own.</p>

        <p></p>
        <p> <span class="note-bold">Pooling Sovereignty</span>
            means, in practice, that the member states
            delegate some of their decision-making powers
            to shared institutions they have created.</p>
        <p>In this way, decisions on specific matters of joint interest
            can be made democratically at European level.</p>

            Treaties created the three
            <span class="note-bold">European Communities</span>, which is
            the system of joint decision-making on coal, steel, nuclear power
            and other major sectors of the member states' economies.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="note-bold">The common institutions set up to manage this system</span>
            were merged in 1967,
            resulting in a <span class="note-bold">single Commission</span> and
            a <span class="note-bold">single Council of Ministers</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span class="note-bold">The EEC</span>,
            in addition to its economic role, gradually took on a wide range of
            responsibilities,
            including social, environmental and regional policies.
            Since it was no longer a purely economic community,
            <span class="note-bold">the Fourth Treaty(Maastricht)</span>
            renamed it simply
            <span class="note-bold">the European Community (EC)</span>.
            As the
            <span class="note-bold">ECSC Treaty</span>
            approached expiry in 2002, responsibilities for coal and steel
            were progressively merged into other Treaties.
        </p>

        <p>At Maastricht, the member state governments also agreed
            to work together on
            <span class="note-bold">Foreign and Security Policy</span>
            and in the area of
            <span class="note-bold">Justice and Home Affairs</span>.
            By adding this intergovernmental cooperation
            to the existing Community system,
            <span class="note-bold">the Maastricht Treaty</span>
            created a new structure with
            <span class="note-bold">Three Pillars</span>

                        It will send the Council an amended proposal.

                Its origins go back to the 1950s and the founding Treaties.

            Reflections of Simone Veil -- the first president to be
            elected directly,
            in other words by universal suffrage.</p>
        <div class="note-95">
            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                "In the spring of 1979, I was Minister for Health and
                Social Security when, a few months before the first elections
                to the European Parliament by universal suffrage,
                President Giscard d'Estaing asked me if I would be
                willing to head
                a list of candidates for this election.</p>
            <span class="note-bold"> </span>
            <span class="note-bold"> </span>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                I accepted this honour without hesitation,
                having been a military supporter of European integration
                since the end of the war, regarding it as the only way to set
                the seal on reconciliation between France and Germany and
                avoid a recurrence of the tragedies of the past.
            </p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                After the excellent result achieved by my list,
                President Giscard d'Estaing who was sensitive to
                symbols of reconciliation and hence aware of
                a former deportee, suggested to the other governments
                that I should be made President of the new Parliament,
                something that I had never imagined happening.
                That is how, on 13 July 1979,
                by an absolute majority in the second round,
                I came to be elected President of the new assembly.
            </p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                The task that now faced me was not without its problems.
                First of all, the nature of the new Member's mandate
                had changed now that they were elected by universal suffrage,
                as opposed to the former situation in which members of
                the Assembly were representatives of the national parliaments.
                The democratic underpinning had now become more direct.
                In addition, Parliament's rules of procedure turned out
                to be inappropriate for its new role,
                not least in budgetary terms.
            </p>

            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                To this was added a geographical issue.
                Up to then the European Assembly had usually met in Luxembourg,
                where most of its officials also lived. In Strasbourg, the Parliament had neither its own chamber nor
                any offices, and therefore had to squat for one week each month in the premises of the Council of
                Europe, bringing all the necessary documents with it from Luxembourg. One can imagine that this
                peripatetic existence was not to the liking of some of the parlamentarians, so that I had to contain a
                certain level of disgruntlement. It took months for this modus operandi to become second nature. We
                still had to continue to hold a few sessions in Luxembourg. It was there that I remember with emotion
                welcoming the Egyptian
                President Anwar El Sadat not long before he was assasinated.
            </p>


            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                The Members of the European Parliament, as one can imagine,
                wanted to assert their new authority in budgetary matters.
                The budget that had been drawn up for 1980 turned out to have
                slightly exceeded the ceiling allocated by
                the treaties to the European Parliament.
                As the point in issue was combating world hunger,
                I unhesitantly declared this budget to have been duly adopted. The French Government immediately brought
                an action before the Court of Justice. It took some time for agreement to be reached between the
                Parliament, the Council and the national governments,
                particularly the one in Paris.

            </p>



            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                I remember the real interest that the new European Parliament
                aroused outside the Community in those now distant days.
                This interest and curiosity was all the greater because
                the Presidency of the Parliament was given to a woman,
                which at that time was still looked upon with some
                disapproval.
                I was able to observe this when I went to LomÃ© for
                the signing of the treaties with the African,
                Pacific and Caribbean countries.
            </p>


            <p style="font-style: italic;">
                I remember that both inside and outside the Community
                I always received a warm welcome,
                including in the United States, Canada, China and Japan.
                Whenever possible I involved the Commission permanent
                representatives in these visits.

                <span class="note-bold">
                    Throughout a presidency that lasted two and a half years,
                    I never had any difficulty in always being seen by myself
                    and others as standing above party divisions
                    and representing the whole of Parliament. </span>
                <span class="note-bold"> </span>

            </p>



            <p style="font-style: italic;">

                In short, this sometimes difficult, always fascinating presidency
                has remained the most rewarding period of my life.
                I look back on it with nostalgia, as I do on the subsequent years
                I spent at the European Parliament before returning to the French
                government in 1993."

                The European Union represents a unique model of life and society.
                It is based on equal rights and solidarity.
                Its foundation is our common values, particularly respect for human dignity,
                freedom, democracy and compliance with the law.
                The European Parliament defends these rights beyond the borders of
                the European union, all over the world.
                In many countries, even outside the European Union, the voice of
                the European Parliament has considerable moral authority.

        <div class="note-95">
            <p>Parliament passes European laws jointly with the Council in many policy areas.
                The fact that the EP is directly elected by the citizens of the EU helps
                guarantee
                the democratic legitimacy of the European law.</p>
            <p>We have already seen the procedures used for passing new EU laws

            </p>
            <p>The most common procedure for adopting, i.e

                <span class="note-bold">codecision</span>.

            <p> <span class="note-bold">Codecision Procedure </span>

            <ul>
                <li>When a new Commission takes office,
                    its members are nominated by the governments of the
                    EU countries, but they cannot be appointed without
                    Parliamentâ€™s approval.
                </li>
                <li>Parliament interviews each of them individually,
                    including the prospective Commission President,
                    and then votes on whether to approve the Commission as a whole.
                </li>
                <li>Throughout its term of office,
                    the Commission remains politically accountable to Parliament,
                    which can pass a 'motion of censure'
                    requiring the Commissionâ€™s mass resignation.
                </li>
                <li>More generally, Parliament exercises control by
                    regularly examining reports sent to it by the Commission
                    â€“ the annual general report, reports of the implementation
                    of the budget, etc.
                </li>
                <li>Moreover, MEPs regularly ask the Commission questions which
                    the commissioners are legally required to answer.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h4 id="sep_role_2_2">Supervision over the Council </h4>

            <p>Parliament also monitors the work of the Council.
                MEPs regularly ask the Council questions,
                and the President of the Council attends the EPs plenary sessions
                and takes part in important debates.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4 id="sep_role_2_3">Petitions from Citizens </h4>
            <p>Parliament can exercise further democratic control by examining petitions
                from citizens
                and setting up committees of inquiry.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h4 id="sep_role_2_4">Input to EU Summit </h4>
            <p>Finally, Parliament provides input to every EU summit â€“ i.e.
                the European Council meetings. At the opening of each summit,
                the President of Parliament is invited to express Parliamentâ€™s views
                and concerns about topical issues
                and the items on the European Councilâ€™s agenda.</p>

            <p>It was set up in 1949 and one of its early achievements was
                to draw up the European convention on Human Rights. </p>
            <p>To enable citizens to exercise their rights under that convention,

                and to reshuffle these responsibilities (if necessary)

            <p>The Commission generally meets once a week, usually on Wednesdays,

                Each item on the agenda is presented by

                and the whole team then takes a

            </p>
            <p>Each DG is responsible for a particular Policy Area and
                is headed by a Director-General who is answerable
                to one of the Commissioners. </p>
            <p>Overall coordination is provided by the Secretariat-General,
                which also manages the weekly Commission meetings.
                It is headed by the Secretary General, who is

        <div class="note-117">
            <p>It is the DGs that actually devise and draft Legislative Proposals,
                but these proposals become official only when
                'adopted' by the Commission at its weekly meeting. </p>
            <p>The Procedure is roughly as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Suppose, for example, that the Commission sees a need
                    for EU Legislation to prevent pollution of Europe's rivers. </li>
                <li>The Directorate-General for the Environment will draw up a proposal,
                    based on extensive consultations with European Industry,
                    Farming and Environmental Organisations,
                    and Environment Ministries in the EU countries. </li>
                <li>The draft will also be discussed with other Commission Departments
                    with an interest in this topic, and checked by the Legal Service and the
                    Secretariat-General.
                </li>
                <li>Once the proposal is fully ready,
                    it will be put on the agenda of a Commission Meeting</li>
                <li>If at least 14 of the 27 Commissioners approve the proposal,
                    the Commission will adopt it
                    and it will have the Whole Team's Unconditional Support. </li>
                <li>The document will then be sent to the
                    Council and the European Parliament for them to decide
                    on the Proposal. </li>
                <li>The Commission may subsequently make amendments in the light of the comments from
                    these Two Institutions and then
                    send the Proposal back for Final Approval.</li>
